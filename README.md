<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
These are the steps needed to install and run the app. This may vary from system to system and may need extra installations, terminals, or virtual environments to achieve the best results.
### Package/Library Installation
On a Python 3.6+ environment, run:
`pip install soccer-twos`
## Usage
This is a general guide on the workflow of our app and how to regularly use it.
1. Upon entering the app, the first official page we see is the login page. 
   - Users can load in their past data if they have an existing account, or they can start anew and begin recording run sessions from there.
2. After logging in, they arrive on the homepage where the user will be able to see their past run sessions.
   - This is expected to be blank if the user has a newly created account and has not begun collecting session data via fitness device or app.
   - Users will be able to tap into these sessions to view the data or delete the session.
3. Select the Recommend button on the bottom of the page to begin the process of tailoring the next run session.
4. The user will then be redirected and prompted to select their choice of difficulty for the next session
   - Options: Easy, Medium, Hard
5. Upon submitting the selection, the app will provide three suggestions for the user's next run session: distance to run, time to spend running, and the pace based off those values.
